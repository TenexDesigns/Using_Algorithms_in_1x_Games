The provided readme from the "Klondike-Solver" project on GitHub explains the usage and options of the Klondike (Patience) Solver. The solver is designed to find minimal length solutions for Klondike (Patience) solitaire games.

Heres a breakdown of the options mentioned in the readme:

KlondikeSolver: The command to execute the Klondike solver.

/DRAW # [/DC #]: Sets the draw count to use when solving. The default draw count is 1.

/DECK str [/D str]: Loads the deck specified by the string. The deck format represents the order a deck of cards is dealt to the board.

/GAME # [/G #]: Loads a random game with seed #.

FilePath: Solves deals specified in the file.

/R: Replays the solution to output if one is found.

/MOVES /MVS: Will output a compact list of moves made when a solution is found.

/MULTI # [/M #]: Uses # threads to solve deals. Only works when solving minimally.

/OUT # [/O #]: Sets the output method of the solver. Defaults to 0, 1 for Pysol, 2 for minimal output.

/STATES # [/S #]: Sets the maximum number of game states to evaluate before terminating. Defaults to 5,000,000.

/FAST [/F]: Run the solver in a best attempt mode, which is faster but not guaranteed to give a minimal solution or one at all.

The notes section provides information about the deck format and how each card is represented by a 3-digit long numerical character, with the first two digits representing the value of the card and the third digit representing the suit.

To use the Klondike-Solver, you need to execute it with the desired options and parameters in the command line or terminal. For example:

sql
Copy code
KlondikeSolver /DRAW 3 /OUT 1 /STATES 1000000 /FAST /G 12345
This command will run the Klondike solver with a draw count of 3, Pysol output method, a maximum of 1,000,000 game states to evaluate, best attempt mode, and loads a random game with seed 12345.

Keep in mind that the "Klondike-Solver" project is a tool designed for developers and researchers interested in solving Klondike solitaire games programmatically. It provides options to fine-tune the solving process and produce different outputs based on the specified parameters.

The Klondike-Solver project is a solver for the Klondike (or Patience) game that aims to find the minimal length solutions.

Heres how you can use the Klondike-Solver project based on the instructions provided in the README.txt:

Command-line usage You can use the KlondikeSolver executable with various command-line options:

KlondikeSolver [/DC] [/D] [/G] [/O] [/M] [/S] [/F] [/R] [FilePath]
Each option is described in the README:

/DRAW # [/DC #]: Sets the draw count to use when solving. Defaults to 1.
/DECK str [/D str]: Loads the deck specified by the string.
/GAME # [/G #]: Loads a random game with seed #.
FilePath: Solves deals specified in the file.
/R: Replays solution to output if one is found.
/MOVES /MVS: Will output a compact list of moves made when a solution is found.
/MULTI # [/M #]: Uses # threads to solve deals. Only works when solving minimally.
/OUT # [/O #]: Sets the output method of the solver. Defaults to 0, 1 for Pysol, 2 for minimal output.
/STATES # [/S #]: Sets the maximum number of game states to evaluate before terminating. Defaults to 5,000,000.
/FAST [/F]: Run the solver in a best attempt mode, which is faster, but not guaranteed to give minimal solution or one at all.
Deck format The deck is represented by a string of 3-digit numerical characters. The first two digits represent the value of the card (01 for an ace, 02 for a 2, 11 for a jack, 13 for a king), and the third digit represents the suit (1 for clubs, 2 for diamonds, 3 for hearts, 4 for spades). For example, an Ace of spades is represented by 014, and a 4 of diamonds is represented by 042.

Moves When using the /MOVES command, the program will output the necessary moves to achieve a winning condition:

DR#: A draw move that is done # number of times. For example, DR2 means draw twice.
NEW: Represents moving cards from the Waste pile back to the stock pile.
F#: Flip the card on tableau pile #.
XY: Move the top card from pile X to pile Y. X can be 1 through 7, W for Waste, or a foundation suit character ('C' for clubs, 'D' for diamonds, 'S' for spades, 'H' for hearts). Y can be 1 through 7 or a foundation suit character.
XY-#: Same as above, but you are moving # number of cards from X to Y.
You can run the KlondikeSolver executable with the appropriate command-line options to solve a game of Klondike. The output will depend on the options you used. For example, if you use the /MOVES command, the output will be a list of moves that lead to a winning condition. github.com
